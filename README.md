# Virtual Home Lab Network
-- Networking project --

## Requirements
- 1 Router
- 1 Firewall
- 1 Switch
- 1 Server (Active Directory)
  - DHCP, DNS
- 4 End Devices

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to demonstrate ability to perform network configurations on a small scale such as a home lab, providing connectivity between all the users and users being a part of one domain controller. To complete this mini project I will be using GNS3 to create the network topology and configure network devices, and Oracle VirtualBox to configure and run virtual machines specifically for the server and end users. 

## Outline
### Configure Virtual Machines
First step is to get our virtual machines ready. This will include needing the Windows Server 2022 image file, a Windows 11 image file, and for ease of creating the project, a GNS3 image. This git repo is not targeted to help configure a virtual machine since it also differs what specs you will give your virtual machine, so I will leave links here on how to set up your virtual machine if it is your first time.
